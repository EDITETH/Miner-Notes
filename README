A perl script to parse targetless ore data files.

Author:  Wonko
Version:  Pre-Alpha


Usage:

Select a file to load, and click the 'Load data from targetless file' button, then be patient for ~20 seconds.


Notes:

The entry for selecting what file to load supports file links ("file://{some file}").
You should be able to copy a file, and paste it to the entry!


Coming soon(tm):

I'm working on being able to merge targetless data together.  Shouldn't take me too much longer!
