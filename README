A perl script to parse, merge, and generate data files used by the 'targetless' Vendetta Online plugin.


Author:  Wonko
Version:  Still Pre-Alpha


Usage:

Select a file to load, and click the 'Load this file' button, then be patient.
This process shouldn't take more than ~30 seconds.

If you wish to merge that data with a second file, enter the second file's name, then click 'Merge this file with current data'.
This process can take a few minutes, something I'm working on speeding up.

Once a new file is generated from your current data set, you'll still need to copy it over your old targetless file.
Generating a new targetless file can also take a little while.

Before you copy the new data file over, DON'T FORGET TO BACKUP YOUR OLD TARGETLESS FILE!
I've talked to drazed, and the new files should be 100% safe to use, but backups never hurt, right?

Notes:

The entry for selecting what file to load supports file links ("file://{some file}").
You should be able to copy a file, and paste it to the entry!

Coming soon(tm):

*Faster parsing and merging
*More sorting options
*Pre-compiled versions for people who don't get perl/Tk love by default.

Maybe another idea or two I'm thinkg about...

What features would YOU like to see added?

Special Thanks:

drazed, for creating targetless and helping me understand the format targetless uses!
